# FreezeScaleTree
Bakes and resets all scale values to 1,1,1 for the whole hierarchy starting from selected object. All scaling values are baked in geometry, so no visual changes will happen. Useful when importing scenes from other DCC apps and getting large or small scale values. 

# KeyVisibility
Add visibility keyframes to main or active take for quickly animating object hiding/showing

# PromoteSelectedTakeParams
Moves selected take overrides to parent take (or Main take if that is the parent). Useful when you have accidentaly set some parameter in take, but you want it to be global (in main take).
